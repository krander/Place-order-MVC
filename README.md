# OrdersMVC

1. Create a new MVC app called OrdersMVC. Create a new model called Order that has these properties: an ID, an order date, a customer id, and a spot for comments. Remember a model is just a POCO class (Plain Old Class Objects).

2. Create a new empty controller called OrderController, and an empty view called Order â€“ but set the view up with the Order model you created in the previous step. Visual Studio should prompt you to do this when you create a new view. 

3. In the Index action of your controller, create a new instance of your model and populate the properties with some data. Then display that data in the view.
